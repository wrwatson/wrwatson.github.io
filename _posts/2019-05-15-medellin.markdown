Metro de Medellín
=================
The metro system in Medellín must be the best-priced site seeing tour in the world.
Fares are charged based on entrance and exit used.
The system is integrated so it's possible to ride the trains and
cablecars to safely see the city for about $1 AUD.

Rich people live in the valley and the houses become more informal in the heights.

Learnt sad, interesting and progressive history of Medellin.

Plaza Cisneros (Known as lights park). This square was the main market in Medellín until a fire destroyed it. The area was left and become home to many drug addicts and some unfavourable people. As part of a renewal program to rejuvenate the city they constructed a bamboo forest and a light forest with 300 light poles. They also built a library in the square.

This is one of two buildings, called Vasquez and Carre buildings, that were derelict in Plaza Cisneros. The drug lords squatted and set up headquarters in these buildings. As part of the renewal process they renovated these buildings and they now house the head office of the Education Department.

Fernando Botero, a famous artist, from Medellín donated 23 sculptures to this park now called Parque Botero. This area was an unsavoury part of Medellín and now is a thriving area filled with both locals and tourists.

San Antonio Park is the home to more of Botero’s sculptures. This was a sculpture of a bird that in 1995 housed a bomb that killed 29 people at a music festival and injured hundreds more. The Mayor ordered the removal of the sculpture however the artist intervened saying it needed to stay as a reminder of the tragedy. He provided an identical sculpture of a bird, which was placed next to this one, to represent “peace” and to show that the people of Medellín have survived tragedy and have moved forward in peace.
